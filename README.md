### N-Queens problem

The eight queens problem is the problem of placing eight queens on an 8Ã—8 chessboard such that none of them attack one another (no two are in the same row, column, or diagonal).

We used genetic algorithms in order to solve this problem.


### GA's parameters

- *Elites* number of fittest chromosomes to keep after each generation
- *population_size* number of chromosomes 
- *max_generations* number of generations 
- *crossover rate* pre-defined parameter of the crossover rate, equals to *0.8*
- *mutation rate* pre-defined parameter of the mutaion rate, equals to *0.2*

### Testing
The class *GeneticAlgorithm* implements the needed algorithms such as *crossingOver*, *mutation*, *selection*, *fitness calculation* and *evolving*

```python
data = [0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7]
ga = GeneticAlgorithm(data, max_weight=12210, max_volume=12, max_generations=60, population_size=200, elites=2) 
```

To run the algorithm,
```python
ga.run()
```

To print the evolution graph:
```python
ga.printEvolutionGraph()
```
